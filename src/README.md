## Integrating Data

This guide walks you through the process of using 
Spring Integration to create a simple application 
that retrieves data from an RSS Feed (Spring Blog), 
manipulates the data, and then writes it to a file. 
This guide uses traditional Spring Integration XML 
configuration. Other guides show how to use Java 
Configuration and DSL with and without Lambda 
expressions.

We will create a flow with Spring Integration by 
using traditional XML configuration.
